# DSCI 554 Milestone 3

## Tidy Submission (5%)
rubric={mechanics:5}

- In each team member's private github.ubc.ca `milestone3` repo, in the README file:
  - include the URL to your project (github.com) repo,
  - include the URL to a tagged release (named v3.0) on your project (github.com) repo.
- Be sure to follow the [general lab instructions](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/general_lab_instructions/) that are relevant, while also following the specific instructions described herein.

Note that submissions where the tagged release on your project (github.com) repo are dated later than the due date will receive a grade of 0.

## Expectations
rubric={reasoning:37,accuracy:11,quality:11,viz:21,writing:15}

You are expected to meet the overall project goals, as set out in the [releaseÂ README](https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-2018-19/DSCI_554_exper-causal-inf_students/blob/master/release/README.md).

Additional report expectations:

- Your target audience is other Data Scientists who are not familiar with your project.
- Clearly introduce the survey topic and question you were interested in answering.
- Link to your study's data and code in the methods section of your report.
- Include effective visualizations and/or tables that help communicate your findings.
- Your discussion should have 2 key focuses:
  1. Discussing the results and findings of your survey and analysis of the survey data.
  2. Discussing your survey/study design, specifically:
    - what did you do well to make this study as causal as possible?
    
    >What we are interested in is causal mechanisms for behavior of being late to school. What factors cause someone to be late? For example, having breakfast at home or on campus, going to the clubs or not, etc. So, we want to find out the causal mechanisms and confounding factors that cause someone being late to school. We develop a survey study to access possible confounding factors. These factors can be assessed through survey, which gives us a way to measure these factors. 
    
    - what was not done well and how did that effect your studies conclusions?
    
    >Some confounders may not be necessarily included in the survey, such as performance in MDS which may not necessarily affect commute time. Also, we could have include factors such as attitudes, self-efficacy, and norms. For example. we could include another confounder of whether people in general the type of person are who likes to be on time or nor. We would imagine that someone who is very worried about being on time would arrive early regardless of how far they lived.

    - what would you do differently next time to improve your survey/study design and why?
    
    >Next time, we would increase our sample size. Given the nature of our study, our dependent variable is very zero inflated, which leaves us very small sub set of non-zero dependent variable. And we would also add temporal factors since we are asking people about their behavior over a past period of time.


## Teamwork report

Don't forget to submit your teamwork report by Sunday, as stated in the [course README](https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-2018-19/DSCI_554_exper-causal-inf_students/blob/master/README.md#3-assessments). We've opened a new `teamwork` repository for you on `github.ubc.ca` for you to submit this to, so don't include the teamwork report as part of Milestone 3.
